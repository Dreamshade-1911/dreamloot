*** Fix ***

*** Implement ***
* Show where the loot is sold (sorted by NPC)
* Calculate waste based on supplies used (by player)
* Fill out database.
* Ability to navigate through autocomplete suggestions with the arrow keys
* Hotkeys
* Sidebar menu with some options (like minimum value on loot, so that everything below that gets ignored by autocomplete and "add creature items")
* Calculate how many items are in a backpack of a specific item by the weight of the backpack
