*** Fix ***
* Use binary search for db arrays that are alphabetically sorted.

*** Implement ***
* Ability to navigate through autocomplete suggestions with the arrow keys
* Sidebar menu with some options (like minimum value on loot, so that everything below that gets ignored by autocomplete and "add creature items")
* Option to blacklist items / locations (sidebar menu)
* Calculate how many items are in a backpack of a specific item by the weight of the backpack
* Link to state of the tables so people can share loot calculations
* Expand button on the players hunt info to view detailed info about supplies used and cost of each
* Item sprites on "where to sell"
* Predetermined hunting spots that adds all the creatures from the hunt.
