# DreamLoot
Little utility to help calculate the worth of your loot on Medivia Online and where to sell it.

[Feature Preview](https://dreamshade-1911.github.io/dreamloot/preview)

The main website has tested and stable code, the feature preview has things currently being worked on and might not be stable. Feel free to use the preview and fallback to the main website if you have any trouble.

Please, don't use this as a learning source of good coding practices. This was one of my first projects to go public and contains a lot of dumb/inneficient stuff. Feel free to improve it if you want, but be warned, it's a mess in there.
